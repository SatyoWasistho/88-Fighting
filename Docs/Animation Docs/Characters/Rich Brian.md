# Character Reference: Rich Brian
So Brian is like our mascot character, kind of the game's Jin Kazama. Average size, average movement, decently comfortable at every range. His design is really basic. Two things about animating him that are gonna be the most complicated are:

 - His coat. For any kind of fast, full-body motion, it basically follows cape physics.
 - His glasses. It can be tricky to draw them from certain angles at this low of a resolution. With this style, you're gonna find that the resolution makes some things easier and some things harder.
